# Pricing_Asian_Option_under_Heston_Model
I developed a MATLAB function for the calculation of the price of an average strike Asian call option that is priced according to the Heston model (Heston, 1993) with Monte Carlo simulation using the Euler discretization (Lord, Koekkoek and Van Dijk, 2007) scheme.

I also studied on the impact of changing different parameters on the option pricing valuation.
